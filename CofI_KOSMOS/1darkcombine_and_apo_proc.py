    Semi-generalized function to read a "fits" file in, divide by exposure
    time (returns units of ADU/s), and optionally perform basic CCD
    processing to it (bias, dark, flat corrections, biassec and
    illumination region trimming).

    Parameters:

    file: string
    Path to the "fits" file.

    bias: CCDData object (optional), default = None
    Median bias frame to subtract from each flat image.

    dark: CCDData object (optional)
    Dark frame to subtract.

    flat: CCDData object (optional)
    Combined flat frame to divide.

    trim: bool, default = True
    Trim the "bias section" out of each flat frame. Uses "fits" header field defined by "DATASEC" keyword.

    ilum: array (optional)
    If provided, trim image to the illuminated portion of the CCD.

    EXPTIME: string (optional), default = "EXPTIME"
    "Fits" header field containing the exposure time in seconds

    DATASEC: string (optional), default = "DATASEC"
    "Fits" header field containing the data section of the CCD (to remove the bias section). Used if "trim=True".

    Saxis: int (optional), default is 1
    Set which axis is the spatial dimension. 

    Waxis: int (optional), default is 0
    Set which axis is the wavelength dimension. 

    CR: bool, default = True
    If True, use the L.A. Cosmic routine to remove cosmic rays from the image before reducing.

    GAIN: string (optional), default = 0.6
    "Fits" header field containing the "GAIN" keyword used by L.A. Cosmic.

    READNOISE: string (optional), default = 6
    "Fits" header field containing the "RDNOISE" keyword used by L.A. Cosmic.

    CRsigclip: int (optional), default = 35
    Sigma-clipping parameter passed to L.A. Cosmic.

    gain_apply: bool (optional), default = False
    Apply gain to image. If it is set to True and bias or flat are not in units of electrons per adu, this may result in an error.

    """
    This function first checks whether the dark files provided by user
    have the same exposure time. If not, it gives an error and interrupts execution.
    Then, it subtracts bias from each individual dark frame and uses Jim Davenport's
    "pykosmos.biascombine" function to combine the calibrated dark frames.
    Finally, it appends "EXPTIME" keyword to the header of the file containing
    the combined dark frame that has the same exposure time value as the raw
    dark files provided by user. Please read the "Parameters" for information
    regarding "trim" and "ilum_value" parameters.

    Parameters:

    darkfiles_list: numpy ndarray
    An array of dark files to combine.

    bias: string
    Path to the "fits" file containing the combined bias frame.

    directory: string
    Path to the place where each calibrated dark file
    as well as the resulting combined dark frame will be stored.

    trim: bool (optional), default is False
    If set to True, trim the sections that correspond to "bias" and "ilum"
    parameters in the "apo_proc" function also used to reduce a science image.
    This is only done so that a user can compare the combined dark frame and
    science image in ds9. This step makes the combined dark frame the same
    size as the reduced science image. If the user needs to use the combined dark frame later
    in the pipeline, he/she needs to use the dark frame that hasn't been trimmed.
    Trimming is ONLY for COMPARISON in DS9!!! This parameter can only be set to True
    once the user ran the function once, because "trim" requires another parameter
    that comes from "flatcombine" function below, and that function takes untrimmed
    combined dark frame as an optional parameter. If the user decides to plot the combined
    dark frame in ds9 against the science image, the user needs to come back to
    this function, set this parameter to True, and provide a value for the following parameter.

    ilum: numpy array (optional), default is None
    If trim is set to True, this value must be provided. This is the ilum value from
    the "flatcombine" function below.
